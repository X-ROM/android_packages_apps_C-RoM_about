Based on Omni-ROM which is based off AOSP

Dirty Unicorns (DU) is a custom ROM originally based off AOKP but now OMNI-ROM, brings you a great mix of stability and customization. The idea to start a ROM like this was purely out of boredom but later turned into a form of an addiction, a good one. We began to have fun while still doing things the right way. By doing so, we received high praise from not only our users but by fellow developers of other ROMs that enjoy seeing things done the right way. This ROM will always be free of charge without any strings attached or any of it's developers luring you into donating or any form of "pay to flash".
